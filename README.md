This is my personal project of a restaurant that offers pizza. There is a navigation bar with a logo, number, company name and tabs. There is a homepage with an attractive promotion. There is a section about the company in which its vision and activities are described. There is a menu section where we can check what pizza is currently being served along with prices and ingredients. There is also a contact section, where we can check the company's location, opening hours and contact number. We also have a social media footer.

The application is fully responsive for all types of devices. It has smooth transitions between sections. The navigation bar is adapted to mobile devices.

I have also implemented a 3D pizza model on the homepage.

Technology used: React.js, ReactThreeFiber, JavaScript, TailwindCSS, Next.js.

This is part I of the project. In the next one, I plan to add the possibility of ordering online.
